  ## Description
  This SVG Logo Maker application dynamically generates a simple logo for anyone to use as an svg file. You can customize up to three letters for your logo, three different shapes (circle, square, triangle), and the color of your shape and text. This eliminates the need to pay someone to build a logo for you. My motivation for building this application was to build something that demonstrates my ability to build back end applications through node using inquirer and jest.
